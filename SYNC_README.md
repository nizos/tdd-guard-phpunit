# TDD Guard PHPUnit Reporter

This repository is automatically synchronized from the main [TDD Guard monorepo](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard).

## Important Notice

**This is a read-only mirror.** Please do not submit pull requests here.

- **Source code**: https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard/tree/main/reporters/phpunit
- **Issues**: https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard/issues
- **Pull requests**: https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard/pulls

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev tdd-guard/phpunit
```

## Why a Separate Repository?

Packagist requires composer.json to be at the root of the repository. Since TDD Guard is a monorepo containing multiple packages (npm, Python, PHP), we maintain this synchronized copy specifically for Packagist distribution.

## Synchronization

This repository is automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the `reporters/phpunit` directory in the main repository.
